# Hardware PWM
This code is intended for use on the MSP430G2553. The code begins by stting pins to their inputs and outputs as well as setting ccr1 to 500 which will be a 50% duty cycle. In this case, pin 1.6 is the PWM output. After the inputs and outputs are assigned, the timerA parameters are set. The period for the timer is set to 1kHz, it is set to reset/set mode and TA0CCR is set to the 50% duty cycle. When the button is pressed it will trigger an interrupt. The interrupt service routine includes a function that increases the duty cycle by 10%, meaning the LED will get brighter with each button press. At the end of the ISR the duty cycle is set back to 50% and the interrupt flag is cleared.
