# Software PWM
The code is intended for use on the MSP430G2553. The code uses software to change the duty cycle of the onboard LED. First the CCR values are set to 125 for on and off values which will result in a 50% duty cycle. First, the clock and inputs/outputs are set. In this case there are two interrupts. One to trigger on timer A0 and another to trigger on a button press. The timer interrupt uses multiple if statements to set the duty cycle which is accomplished by changing the vlaues for ccr on and off for certain conditions. The second interrupt is for a button press and will decrease the duty cycle until the LED is off.
