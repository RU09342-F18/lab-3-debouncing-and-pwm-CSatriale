# Software Debouncing
This code is intended for use on the MSP430G2553. This code is for debouncing the button on the board. The button corresponds to the pin 1.3. The code works by fist setting the input and output pins and pull up resistor. Next, the interrrupt for pin 1.3 is enabled, meaning when the button is pressed the board will execute the interrupt service routine. In this case, the clock parameters are set and then there is a timer that counts to a specific value. Once the value is reached and the button is still pressed, the LED will light.
